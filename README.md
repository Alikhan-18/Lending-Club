## Lending Club Loan Score Determination

Our project aims to develop a robust loan scoring system leveraging data analytics and Distributed Processing framework. The primary objective is to gather and analyze comprehensive financial data of potential borrowers, including Payment History, Loan Defaults, and Financial Health indicators. We utilize PySpark for efficient data cleaning and transformation to ensure data integrity and streamline preprocessing.

Few of the observations that were handled effectively

1. Data Acquisition: Collect diverse datasets containing customer financial details, encompassing payment history,   loan defaults, and indicators of financial health.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Utilize PySpark for efficient preprocessing, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.

3. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from raw data, such as payment behavior patterns, credit utilization ratios, and debt-to-income ratios, indicative of borrower risk.

4. Deployment: Implement the finalized loan scoring model for integration into the lending institution's infrastructure, facilitating seamless incorporation into the loan approval workflow 

Expected Deliverables:

Comprehensive dataset compiled from various sources, cleaned and transformed using PySpark.
Feature-engineered dataset enriched with borrower characteristics.
Documentation detailing data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, and modeling processes.
Deployment-ready implementation of the loan scoring model for integration into the lending institution's systems.

Impact:

By developing an accurate loan scoring system, lending institutions can make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, reducing default risks and optimizing lending portfolios. The use of PySpark for data preprocessing ensures scalability and efficiency, facilitating streamlined batch processing for future analytics endeavors. Ultimately, our project aims to enhance the lending process, promoting responsible lending practices and financial inclusion.
